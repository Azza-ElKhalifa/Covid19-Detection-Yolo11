# COVID-19 Detection and Localization on Chest Radiographs

This project detects and localizes COVID-19 abnormalities in chest radiographs using computer vision techniques. COVID-19 has presented significant diagnostic challenges as its pulmonary appearance often resembles other types of pneumonia. This model aims to assist radiologists and non-radiologists in making quick, confident diagnoses by detecting and localizing disease patterns in radiographic images.

## Task Description

The goal of this notebook is to detect and localize COVID-19 abnormalities in chest radiographs. Specifically, the notebook covers:

- **Data Loading**: Converting DICOM images into JPEG format for easier processing.
- **Model Training**: Training a model to classify and localize COVID-19 patterns, including bounding box annotation.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the modelâ€™s performance using metrics suitable for localization and classification.

This project uses data and annotations provided by radiologists in collaboration with the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM), FISABIO, BIMCV, and RSNA.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory.
2. Run the notebook in a Jupyter environment:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook covid19-detection.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook cells sequentially to process images, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

> **Note**: This project aims to assist medical professionals by localizing potential COVID-19 patterns in chest radiographs and should not be used as a sole diagnostic tool.
